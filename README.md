# PurpleLance â€“ Phase 01

Welcome to **Phase 01** of **Project PurpleLance**.

This marks the foundational step of our journey. In this phase, we are setting up a basic codebase that takes **user input** and processes it. This initial implementation serves as the **starting stone** for what PurpleLance will grow into.

## ðŸ§© Overview

- A simple script that demonstrates:
  - Accepting user input
  - Basic processing of that input
- Lays the groundwork for further development phases
- Acts as a reference point for future iterations of the project
